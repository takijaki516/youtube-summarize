# Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
----------------------------

Welcome to the most concise RAG tutorial on all of YouTube! RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation, a powerful component of AI agents that allows large language models (LLMs) to access external knowledge. This capability enables the model to provide more informative answers beyond its training data.

## Understanding RAG
----------------------------

At its core, RAG involves a user submitting a question to an LLM. Instead of the model answering immediately, the question is first directed to a knowledge database. Here, complex vector mathematics is employed to match the user’s question with the most relevant information in the database. This additional context allows the LLM to generate a more accurate response.

### Example Use Case
A practical example of RAG is querying a database of meeting summaries. For instance, a user might ask, "What are the action items from the meeting on the 20th?" The relevant information is retrieved and provided to the LLM, enabling it to formulate a concise answer.

## Document Chunking for Knowledge Database
----------------------------

To incorporate documents into the knowledge database, we need to split them into manageable chunks. This is crucial because when a user question is matched to knowledge, we want to return only relevant sections rather than entire documents. 

- **Chunk Size**: You can experiment with chunk sizes, typically around 100 to 1000 characters.
- **Vector Representation**: Each chunk is converted into vectors and stored as embeddings in a vector database.

### Matching User Questions to Document Chunks
When a user asks a question, we create a vector for that question using the same embedding function used for the document chunks. This vector is then matched against the vector database to find the most relevant chunks, which are returned to the LLM for context.

## Building a Chatbot with Llama 3.1
----------------------------

Now that we understand RAG, let’s create a powerful chatbot using the Llama 3.1 model to interact with local text and PDF documents. 

### Step-by-Step Implementation
1. **Code Repository**: A link to the code will be provided in the video description.
2. **Import Required Packages**: We will use LangChain, Streamlit for the UI, and Hugging Face for accessing Llama 3.1.

3. **Load Environment Variables**: This includes specifying the model and the directory containing the documents.
4. **Document Loading**: Use LangChain's directory loader to import documents into the script.

### Vector Database Initialization
We will use Chroma for a local vector database, which can run in memory or be saved to disk for persistent storage. The embedding function will be created using an open-source Hugging Face embedding model.

## Querying the Vector Database
----------------------------

To retrieve relevant knowledge from the vector database, we define a function that queries the documents based on user questions. This function will return the top five related document chunks.

- **Similarity Search**: We will use the Chroma similarity search function to find the most relevant pieces of knowledge.

## Prompting the LLM
----------------------------

Once we have the relevant document chunks, we format the prompt for the LLM. This involves combining the context from the vector database with the user’s question.

- **Response Generation**: The LLM will generate a response based on the provided context and the user’s question.

## Streamlit UI Implementation
----------------------------

Finally, we will define the Streamlit UI in our main function. This includes:

- **Title and Initial State**: Setting up the title and initializing the state for Streamlit.
- **User Input Handling**: Displaying messages and handling user input.

### Testing the Chatbot
We will test the chatbot with various example questions to ensure it retrieves accurate information from the documents.

- **Example Questions**: Users can ask about specific topics, and the chatbot will provide concise answers based on the documents.
